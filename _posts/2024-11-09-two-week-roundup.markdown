It's been two weeks of leave so far! Here's a roundup of what I've been up to.

## Cooking

I've been doing a lot more cooking these two weeks! In no particular order
and as I can remember:

 * Sour cherry and vanilla scones
 * French toast en masse
 * Butternut squash pasta
 * Winter roots pasta
 * Pumpkin spice honey
 * Experimenting with [freezer cocktails](https://books.google.com/books/about/Freezer_Door_Cocktails.html)
 * Mushroom stroganoff

Later today we're doing rack of lamb and Indian bitter melon.

## Reading

I couldn't resist a very cute, very tiny box set of The Hobbit + LOTR to
celebrate the beginning of my sabbatical. I'm in the middle of The Hobbit now,
but it's slow going because I've been much more focused on knitting and
videogames. In the last couple weeks I also read:

### A Prayer for the Crown-Shy, Becky Chambers

I have a cute little hardbound copy of Psalm for the Wild Built, the predecessor
to this book, but when I bought it Books Inc didn't have this one. So, as I
biked to my last day of work til Christmastime, I forgot to pack the book I was
actually reading (Spinning Silver) and needed something to do at the bar for
a couple hours, as I quit work around 1 instead of holding out til 4. But this
one jumped out at me at Leigh's - it was on the shelf without its counterpart,
and a book about burnout and whether we really have to find purpose seemed so
apropos for the beginning of my journey that I bought it. I read it in one
sitting at the bar - just enough time for me to wait for my partner and his
coworkers to show up in the afternoon.

### Spinning Silver, Naomi Novik

I read the Scholomance trilogy a couple of years ago and LOVED it, but I hadn't
read any of Naomi Novik's fairytale retellings. I liked this one quite a lot -
it didn't catch me so much at first, but by the second half I was riveted. It's
a really fascinating blend of fantasy and reality - Miryem, one of the protags,
has to contend with both obnoxious winter fae *and* anti-semitism from her
neighbors. Figuring out the mechanics of the magical world and spells around
them, then using those mechanics to their advantage to prevail over evil,
resulting in prosperity and true love for all. This was just a really fun read,
by the end.

### Next...

So it's been a bit slow - again, I've been focusing on other things. After
The Hobbit, next in line is [The House in the Cerulean Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45047384-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea)
by T.J. Klune, and a date with a coffee, a brainless knitting project, and
[Knitting Without Tears](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156558.Knitting_Without_Tears)
by the formative Elizabeth Zimmerman. I'm intending to take another stab at
reading LOTR in print - previously I've only successfully finished them via
audiobook - and will likely bring the rest of the set with me to Vermont next
week.

## Videogames

It has been a good few weeks for games. I find them more engaging than reading
a book (unsurprisingly), and this week I've needed a lot of distraction and
comfort. So I've been playing:

### Satisfactory

My partner and I are around 90 hours into our shared save, working on delivering
the Stage 5 components and finally Saving the Day. However, it's started
crashing and generally being odd in multiplayer, so I think we may be done for
now. The last bug-fixing patch repopulated all of the world exploration
collectibles...which, honestly, kind of sucks.

### Tavern Talk

A cute little visual novel a la Coffee Talk. I only did one playthrough and got
the true ending; to get the rest of the achievements I'd need to play it again
and make mostly opposite choices, then play it at least once more to get the
secret bad ending. I'm not sure I want to spend the time - it's long and
pretty linear.

### The Witness

I finally rolled credits on The Witness! Not much to say here - there were
literally three puzzles between me and credits. I looked up the answer to one
of them, I'm sorry to say. I was also reminded why I had such a hard time
playing this before - something about this particular perspective and camera
effects gives me the super nausea. So, I won't go and do the secret time trial
stuff at the end, I'll call this good enough and hang onto the happy memory.

### A Little to the Left

Oh my goodness this game is SO FUN!!! I enjoyed beating it over a couple
evenings. The puzzles are not hard enough that you feel stumped or need a pen
and paper, but not so easy that it feels purely like a time filler. I played
both DLCs, which I felt were worse quality than the main game, but still a good
time.

### Fields of Mistria

And here it is. This is the reason I haven't been reading. After Trump got
elected this week, by a popular majority too, my general sense of anxiety and
dread has spiked. So I was searching for a cozy blanket of a game to help with
the anxiety before I can even start thinking about taking action - and this
game nails it.

It is, of course, Yet Another Farming Sim. It has the pixel graphics, like
Stardew Valley. It has crops, and cows, and chickens, and a bathhouse, and all
the things. But it *also* has thirst traps! My biggest complaint about SDV is
that the entire romance/friendship portion doesn't appeal to me, because all of
the people of Stardew Valley are obnoxious, terrible people. But it's okay - all
of the people of Mistria are hotties made out of fandom tropes.

So, instead of reading books, I've been alternately bribing the tsundere
rival-to-lover blacksmith with 90's anime hair so that he'll admit he loves me,
and reading fanfic about said blacksmith angstily admitting he loves the farmer.
It's been... really nice.

Also, the fishing game is much less painful than SDV's, and the combat is a
little better (but still not great). I do still tend to prefer combat-free
cozy farming sims, but thanks to SDV the dungeoneering aspect seems to be
considered a requirement. Alas.

## The Master Hand Knitter Program

I've made huge progress these two weeks! And yet, I'm somehow close to where I
was when I started my leave. I decided to reknit almost all of the swatches,
and I'm absolutely tickled with the improvement I got by doing so. I got a bit
further into the questions, and I redid the gauge sheets and did a bit of
writing there. I also noticed requirements I hadn't before, like that the
paper is supposed to be 1500-2000 words and I had written 2600, so I did some
major editing there as well.

As of now, I'm on question 5(?) out of ~22, and I need to knit the mitten. It
was tough to focus this week around the fascism and the dog errands, so I feel
like it wasn't as productive as last week, and I'll be heading to the library
on Sunday to try and put in a full day of question-answering and researching.

I'm still hoping I can get the mitten done and the package out the door before
I go to Vermont, but it's seeming less likely. Perhaps at least I can have my
research materials all sorted so I don't need to take as much shit on the train.
We'll see. Or, maybe I'll take a break from it and only bring Zach's kid's
stocking with me, and finish that on the train instead.

## Other stuff

The other big fun thing is that this week I went with a dear friend to the
Team USA vs. Team Canada women's national hockey team Rivalry Series game in
San Jose. The turnout was just okay, so the energy at the arena left a little
to be desired, but I got to sit with my friend's recreational adult women's
hockey league, which was a TON of fun. Also, I actually saw a few other people
in California wearing PWHL gear - a first for me. Also also, I got to drink a
beer out of a hockey stick. It was unbelievably stupid.

This week the USA elected Trump as our next president. I usually find
political posts after events like this to feel useless or insincere, but I guess
I'll state that I'm incredibly disappointed to see even the popular vote going
towards Trump, and I'm pretty worried for the future. The best way to get
through it, I think, is at the local community level, so I'll be trying to be
more engaged there. Other than that, I'm not sure what to do besides take care
of myself and prepare for the worst.

## Up Next

Next week I leave for Vermont. 4 days on the Amtrak, 4 days baking, then flying
home in time to get all sorted for Thanksgiving. This year it seems like we will
have 11-13 people at Thanksgiving!!! So I'm trying to figure out the food and
especially seating for that. Very, very excited for it all. And hopefully I'll
remember to keep posting through it.
