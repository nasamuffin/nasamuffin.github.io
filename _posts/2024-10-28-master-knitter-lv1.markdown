For more info about the Master Hand Knitter program, see the
[TKGA website](https://tkga.org/certification/master-hand-knitting/).

For those who can use Ravelry and have accounts, you can see my progress on my
[project page](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/nasamuffin/tkga-master-hand-level-1).

I'll work through the list below over the next couple of weeks. Maybe I can
get it in the mail before I leave for Vermont :)

A catalogue of the things I need to do before I can mail my MHK Lv1 binder out:

1. Note updated instruction date on cover page
1. Double-check that the swatches are packed correctly (email and ask)
1. Check swatches for any damage (bugs)
1. Check prior answers in the worksheets
1. Finish the worksheets/comparison table
1. Make the mitten!
1. Block the mitten!
1. Photograph the mitten & post on Ravelry
1. Do the mitten worksheet
1. Check that the website references aren't broken
1. Print cover letter
1. Print instruction cover page (with date)
1. Double-check Ravelry photo documentation
1. Double-check checklist on page 3 of instructions
1. Write the paragraph for the stitch gauge worksheet. (4 references - 2 on
   analyzing gauge, 2 on measuring gauge)

Changes the swatch portfolio:

## Preliminary Swatch
* Redo the swatch and include the pre-blocked gauge sheet too.
* Use the larger needle range to include US9.
* Redo answers to the worksheet

## Swatch 1
* Find reference for increasing evenly in ribbing
* Reprint swatch sheet

## Swatch 2
* Redo it, to do the pre-blocking question.

## Swatch 6
* Get 4 references instead - 2 each for right and left lifted.

## All increase and decrease swatches
* Reread the "guide for another knitter" and see if it makes sense.

## Swatch 11
* Does it still need a reference for the yarnover? (Mail and ask)

## Swatch 13
* Add references for yarnover types

## Swatch 16
* Double check against template

## Swatch 18

Separate references for Figure 8 join (2) and mattress stitch (2)
